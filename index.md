# Few words about myself...

My name is Jan Tyc and I am a 3rd year student of Biomedical Engeenering and 2nd year student of Informatics and AI on Univeristy of AGH in Cracow.

Main intrests of mine include widely meant Machine Learning (specificly Computer Vision, Object Detection and things connected with Neural Networks as all).

I also take a great intrest in non-science fields. Practicing bouldering is my biggest getaway, I've been doing it for about a year now. 

With my friend, Mateusz Piątek, we are hosting a podcast called 'Optymalizatorium' which covers technology usage, psychology and much more current urgent topics.
